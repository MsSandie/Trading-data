## Introduction
This is a Microsoft Power BI project on Northwind Trading Company. An e-commerce and logistics company where innovation meets convenience in the world of online trading. They pride themselves on being at the forefront of the digital marketplace, offering a seamless platform for individuals and businesses to buy and sell goods with ease.

This project is aimed at analyzing the company’s yearly sales, shipping, customers, and employees’ data. This is done to evaluate the performance of the company and to make inference based on the data worked on. This will also help us make informed decisions, and ensure long-term sustainability and productivity. This process involves a comprehensive assessment of the company’s products, customers, employees, orders place and shipping companies used for logistics.

## Problem Statement
The primary goal of this analysis is to gain valuable insights into the operations of the Northwind Trading Company, yearly sales, shipping, customers, and employees’ data. To do these, we will be answering some specific questions using DAX functions. We would also be modeling all the tables to show their relationship, then display all visuals on our well-designed dashboard.

## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated
In this project, I explored most of Power BI’s functions. The following were used in this project: data cleaning using power query editor, DAX functions, visualization (column, bar, line, donut, pie charts, map, slicers), calculated columns, conditional formatting and data modelling.

## Data Sourcing
The dataset was provided as an Excel CSV file, which was imported into our Power BI software. The dataset comprised of seven different tables that are inter-related with primary keys and foreign keys. The tables contain information about the company’s employees, customers, product categories, orders, and shipping details.

## Data Wrangling and Transformation
The data was imported and transformed using power query editor. The data was further examined for null values, duplicates and errors that may affect analysis. Null values in the date column were replaced with the day’s date and updated into our dataset.

## Data Modelling
The tables in the data were modelled based on their relationship. Dimension tables were linked to the fact tables using common columns as the primary keys and vice versa. The cardinality used was the many-to-one cardinality.
